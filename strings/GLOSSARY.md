# Strings

## Overview
Strings are sequences of characters. In most languages, strings are immutable, meaning operations create new strings.

## Common Patterns
- **Two Pointers** - Palindrome checks, reversing
- **Sliding Window** - Substring problems
- **Hash Map** - Character frequency counting
- **StringBuilder** - Efficient string concatenation

## Key Operations
| Operation | Time Complexity |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Access char by index | O(1) |
| Concatenation | O(n) |
| Substring | O(n) |
| Search for substring | O(n*m) |

## Common Problems
- Valid Palindrome
- Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- Valid Anagram
- String to Integer (atoi)
- Longest Common Prefix
