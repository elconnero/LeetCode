# Arrays

## Overview
Arrays are contiguous blocks of memory storing elements of the same type. Most fundamental data structure in programming.

## Common Patterns
- **Two Pointers** - Using two indices to traverse from different positions
- **Sliding Window** - Maintaining a subset of elements as you iterate
- **Prefix Sum** - Precomputing cumulative sums for range queries
- **In-place Modification** - Modifying array without extra space

## Key Operations
| Operation | Time Complexity |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Access by index | O(1) |
| Search (unsorted) | O(n) |
| Search (sorted) | O(log n) |
| Insert/Delete at end | O(1) |
| Insert/Delete at middle | O(n) |

## Common Problems
- Two Sum
- Remove Duplicates
- Rotate Array
- Maximum Subarray
- Merge Sorted Arrays
